<p>Our research group mainly focuses on <strong>the systems approaches to aging and immunity with a multitude of omics analysis, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metagenomics (microbiome)</strong>. Our specific research themes are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-underlying-principles-of-agingsenescence-and-immune-diseases-by-using-multi-omics-and-network-analysis">Understanding the underlying principles of aging/senescence and immune diseases by using multi-omics and network analysis.</h3>
<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/respic/SmartTip.png" alt="" style="width: 200px; float: left; margin: 0px  10px" />
We have applied systematic approaches by combining a broad range of omics data generated from microarray, next generation sequencing, and mass spectrometry. However, the integration of those multi-omics data is still challenging: often we face the discrepancies between the results obtained from several data types and difficulties in inferring the causality rather than correlation, and the problems are getting worse when it comes to the spatiotemporal changes. Thus, we attempt to establish a strategy to analyze the multi-layered omics data, which consists of diverse omics techniques, time, and space, to reveal the fundamental principles of aging/senescence and immune diseases.</p>

<h3 id="identification-of-key-molecules-cellular-processespathways-cell-types-and-microbes-of-the-comorbidities-among-several-immune-disease-andor-aging-systems">Identification of key molecules, cellular processes/pathways, cell-types, and microbes of the comorbidities among several immune disease and/or aging systems.</h3>

It is well known that some diseases can be developed together in one person at the same time, named as ‚Äúcomorbidity‚Äù. For example, several allergic diseases (atopic dermatitis, asthma, and rhinitis) are manifested in a patient during the allergic march. Also, patients with rheumatoid arthritis are likely to have atherosclerosis, and obese individuals are vulnerable to diabetes. Aging and senescence is also closely related with several autoimmune diseases and degenerative diseases. However, it is not clear how these immune disease and/or aging systems are closely intertwined. To this end, our group focuses on unveiling the key factors of comorbidities, which could be molecules, cellular process/pathways, cell-types, or microbes by using diverse omics and network analysis.</p>

<h3 id="construction-of-big-data-databases-or-raw-data-repositories-for-omics-data">Construction of ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù databases or raw data repositories for omics data.</h3>
<p>Our group is a part of Korea Bioinformation Center (KOBIC), which aims to collect all the BioData generated by Korea R&amp;D grants. For example, our group i) contributes to the Korea National Genome Project (NGP), which collects both clinical and genome data from 25,000 participants by 2022, and ii) performs quality control for the omics data collected from the Korea BioData Station (K-BDS) project. Regarding the NGP, we have established analysis pipelines and databases for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data <a href="https://www.kobic.re.kr/ngp/">the NGP website</a>. Moreover, for K-BDS, we have constructed <a href="https://www.kobic.re.kr/kona/">the Korean Nucleotide Archive (KoNA)</a> to provide the collected nucleotide data. All these databases and repositories are publicly accessible, encouraging the scientific communities to get invaluable insights by using the data. Our group also plans on using those ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù to study systems biology of aging and immunity.</p>
