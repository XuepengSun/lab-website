  image: spinach.jpg
  description: Most of us are familiar with \"spinach teeth\" – the harmless but gritty-chalky mouthfeel caused by the vegetable. An international team led by us has identified candidate genes in spinach that regulate its concentration of oxalate, which is responsible for \"spinach teeth\", as well as genes that help the plant combat downy mildew, a major disease of commercial crops.

- title: "The Penium margaritaceum genome: hallmarks of the origins of land plants"
  image: penium.jpg
  description: Penium margaritaceum belongs to a group of freshwater algae called charophytes, and specifically to a subgroup called the Zygnematophyceae, which had a common ancestor with the first land plants some 600 million years ago. In order to shift from water to land – a transition that still puzzles scientists –  plants had to protect themselves from drying out and from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and they had to develop structures to support themselves without the buoyancy provided by water. Through sequencing and analyzing the genome of P. margaritaceum, we and collaborators have found footprints of these adaptations, providing insight into the mechanisms and genetics that early terrestrial plants required.
