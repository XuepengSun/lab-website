  image: penium.jpg
  description: Penium margaritaceum belongs to a group of freshwater algae called charophytes, and specifically to a subgroup called the Zygnematophyceae, which had a common ancestor with the first land plants some 600 million years ago. In order to shift from water to land – a transition that still puzzles scientists –  plants had to protect themselves from drying out and from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and they had to develop structures to support themselves without the buoyancy provided by water. Through sequencing and analyzing the genome of P. margaritaceum, we and collaborators have found footprints of these adaptations, providing insight into the mechanisms and genetics that early terrestrial plants required.

- title: "Phased diploid genome assemblies and pan-genomes provide insights into the genetic history of apple domestication"
  image: apple.jpg
  description: "The fabled Silk Road – the 4,000-mile stretch between China and Western Europe where trade flourished from the second century B.C. to the 14th century A.D. – is responsible for one of our favorite and most valuable fruits: the domesticated apple (Malus domestica). Hybridizations with wild species have made the apple genome very complex and difficult to study, we tackled this problem by applying cutting-edge sequencing technologies and bioinformatics algorithms to assemble complete sets of both chromosomes for the domesticated apple and its two main wild progenitors. We discovered that the apple’s unique domestication history has led to untapped sources of genes that could be used for crop improvement, such as improving size, flavor, sweetness and texture."

Despite their significance, genomic information for AM fungi and their MRE are relatively sparse, which hinders our understanding of their biology and evolution. We assembled the genomes of the AM fungus Diversispora epigaea (formerly Glomus versiforme) and its MRE and performed comparative genomics and evolutionary analyses.
